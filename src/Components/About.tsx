      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
       As a self-taught front-end developer, I am excited to present my
        portfolio to you. My name is Milo≈°, and I become skilled in the design,
        development and deployment of visually pleasing and user-friendly
        websites and web applications. 
        In this portfolio, you will find examples of my work, showcasing my
        capabilities and skills as a self-taught web developer. I am eager
        to take on new challenges and continue to improve my skills and 
        confident that I can deliver high-quality work.
        Throughout my journey as a self-taught developer, I have gained valuable
        experience in understanding user-centered design, web accessibility and
        responsive design. I am a strong collaborator and communicator, able to
        understand the needs of my clients and translate them into visually
        pleasing and functional websites. I have been passionate about web development for quite some time now and
        taught myself the skills needed to become a proficient front-end
        developer. I have a strong understanding of web development technologies
        such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and various front-end frameworks like
        React and Nextjs. I'm also well-versed in design tools such as Figma.  I am a quick learner and always eager to improve my skills. I have a
        great attention to detail and dedicated to producing high-quality,
        scalable and efficient code. I'm always looking for ways to stay
        up-to-date with the latest web development technologies and trends.
